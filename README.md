# Introduction
## The Project
The system allows small scale stores to manage their inventory with the goal of maximising their profit through operational efficiency. It facilitates keeping track of a store's inventory in real-time by allowing users to add new items, update quantities, search and view inventory levels. Future versions will also enable users to generate reports on sales, purchase orders, and other relevant data.
 
## The Context
This project is a Portfolio Project, concluding the Specializations Course work in The ALX Software Engineering Programme.
